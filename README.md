# Automatic-hand-sanitizer-dispensor

During this COVID-19 situation we know social distancing is the only way to stop the virus from spreading. This project is a good initiative to stop the spread of the virus as we wonâ€™t be pressing the bell physically because if the bell was previously pressed by an infected person the virus stays on the bell and when it spreads to another non infected person when he presses the bell. By bringing our hand near to the IR Sensor there will be no direct contact and the doorbell will ring.
